   Please Extract the files directly onto your C drive in order for the code to run smoothly. Some file paths are predetermined for the gui so extracting to a different folder will break the code.
 
   Also when running the gui for the first time you must trust the authors of the folder 

   There are a few improvements I also had in mind that I would be happy to discuss those in person. :)
   Hope all is well
