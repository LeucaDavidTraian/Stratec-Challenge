This is my submission for the Stratec 2025 Software internship challenge. 
I have a few improvements that i want to do and I have commented them along the way
So the plan is to get back into it to make some features actually work and to refine the last 
few calculations in the ways of efficiency and again actually working well not having the code like before
take 15 seconds to compute everything for a small batch of data
